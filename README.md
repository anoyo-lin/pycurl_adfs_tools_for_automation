# pycurl_adfs_tools_for_automation
this tools for the corporation website automation task usage, when we use the basic authentication to login some application and perform some taskes to publish and un-publish some repositories from it, it will be bore and repeat and full of human-error, this experiment just digs into the substance of HTTP 1.1 protocol and realized with PyCurl and also digs into the authentication mechanism of corporation, the ADFS from Microsoft get authenticated from IdP server and get into SSO protal of dedicate repositories.
and Also forge the skill of OOP methodology of Python Programming.
I hope you can shed light of this example.
